# todo

A ToDo app developed using GetX and SQFLite in Flutter can provide users with a simple and effective way to manage their tasks and deadlines. Here are the basic features and functionality that your ToDo app could include:

Home Screen: The home screen of your ToDo app could display the list of tasks that the user has added to the app.

Add Task Screen: A screen to allow users to add a new task to the list. This screen could include fields such as the task description, due date, and priority.

Delete Task: Users should be able to delete a task from the list by swiping it away or using a delete button.

Mark Completed: Users should be able to mark a task as completed once they have finished it.

Filter and Sort: Users should be able to filter and sort their tasks by due date, priority, or completion status.
